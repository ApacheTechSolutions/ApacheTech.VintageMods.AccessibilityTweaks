                Entry-point for the mod. This class will configure and build the IOC Container, and Service list for the rest of the mod.
                
                Registrations performed within this class should be global scope; by convention, features should aim to be as stand-alone as they can be.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
                Only one derived instance of this class should be added to any single mod within
                the VintageMods domain. This class will enable Dependency Injection, and add all
                of the domain services. Derived instances should only have minimal functionality, 
                instantiating, and adding Application specific services to the IOC Container.
